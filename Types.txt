    #Array: 
Hashing
Sorting
Two Pointers
Sliding Window
Dynamic Programming
Binary Search
Greedy Algorithms
Bit Manipulation
Prefix Sum
Divide and Conquer
Backtracking
Stacks and Queues

time complexity:
sort -> nlogn
set -> logn


solutions: 
map, set (unique)
INT_MAX array with default value
(visited array)same array with respective index as element to mark it as visited 
two pointers 1 = first 2 = last or 1 = first 2 = first (move 1 if exeeds, move 2, keep in renge)
